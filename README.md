### Backend

The backend is built with TypeScript and Node.js. It provides the server-side logic for the chess game.

#### Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend1` directory:
   ```bash
   cd chess/backend1
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend

The frontend contains the user interface for the chess game, which might include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
